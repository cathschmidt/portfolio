Before using these techniques in a real-life project, please keep in mind that these are only workarounds and hacks.

They might fix or change the way your text is rendered in a new release, so you would have to keep an eye on the project in the future. On the other hand, I use -webkit-font-smoothing on all my projects to treat all my Mac visitors with a nicely rendered font.</p>
